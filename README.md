Welcome to the OpenCola alpha.

# Installation

## Prerequisites

Download and install Docker from https://www.docker.com/

<details><summary>Why Docker?</summary>
<br>
<p>
OpenCola currently runs inside a docker container, which provides a few advantages over a direct install:

1. It isolates the application so it can only access it's data folder and communicate on controlled ports (5795 for http and 5796 for https)
2. It isolates system dependencies (i.e. the Java 11 runtime)
3. It allows for a network of isolated services to be deployed (i.e. Tor proxy and router)
4. It makes it easy for OpenCola to be hosted on another computer, if desired.
